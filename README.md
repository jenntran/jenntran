- 👋 Hi, I’m @jenntran
- 👀 I’m interested in: creating web applications to help me with things I struggle with in day-to-day life (like remembering what I need to do that day, or my farming route for my favorite video game)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: HTML and CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: open source websites or web applications - especially video game related ones (just a personal love for video games, I'll also work on other interesting ideas!)
- 📫 How to reach me: DMs probably
